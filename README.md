#Background

The intent pf this project is to make a site that can be used by anyone intending to purchase tickets for a good night out in London's clubs as well as extending the market to other cities. Other functionalities include being able to view listings and with the use of the filter functionality, have the results filtered down whe a user keys in searches.

##Installation and Contribution

The core of the project is based in angular, we have tried to limit the scripting to just angular. We are new to the angular world and there may be bugs that we hope to catch as we dive in deep in our development.

To build the background of the site we used tutorials online who used a similar plugin to hook up to the Firebase database.

To run the app these commands are necessary. if you do not have these modules please have them installed. Have node as well as git installed to be able to run npm installs

$ git clone https://github.com/Doc-Khumalo/GotList_P-L

navigate to the folder via console, inside the cloned folder, in your console, run npm start

if you have all the npm modules already in your machine as well as the server, this will start the server.

The console will propt you to copy a "localhost" address for you to paste on your browser then you will see a landing page. this is works in progress, so far the landing page is a sign on screen that is hooked to the Firebase database.

follow the onscreen instructions and you will be directed to the welcome page.

some functionalities are still in progress so they might not function as required.
